# Graph
An InDesign script that create a graph from data in a table

# Directory location
You might want to store that project in a `src/` folder Script Panel directory, e.g. `src/graph`, cause the script file is generated in `../../graph.js` That way, you can have multiple projects stored in yout `src/`directory, but your InDesign script pannel will only show your `*.js`files (with your `src/`directory obviously).

## Please note that thas although some of the functionnality works, this is still a Work In very very Progress !
